# Slides Folder

This folder contains the presentation materials for this project.

## Typical Contents

- **`EmailClassification_Presentation.pptx`** (or `.pdf`)  
  - A 3-4 slide deck summarizing:
    - The business challenge and objectives
    - The technical approach (data prep, modeling, feedback loop)
    - The key stages and outcomes
    - The rationale for choosing specific methods (transformers, multilingual approach, feedback mechanism, etc.)

## Guidelines

1. **Presentation Structure**  
   - Keep slides concise and visually clear, focusing on problem, solution, and results.
2. **File Formats**  
   - You can store PowerPoint, Keynote, or PDF versions. PDF is useful for easy sharing.
3. **Version Control**  
   - If you update slides frequently, maintain a version history or suffix in the filename, like `v1`, `v2`, etc.
4. **Deployment**  
   - Optionally, you may place a link to these slides in the main `README.md` or share them in an internal wiki.

## Future Notes

Feel free to add other documents related to project demos, marketing material, or client-facing presentations within this folder.
